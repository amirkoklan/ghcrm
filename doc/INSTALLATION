    [ExtensionSettings]
    ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ghcrm

# Was not able to move the Sales folder to one level higher paralell with the Home/Root node.
6. Create a "Sales" folder somewhere in your content structure. Note the NodeID of the Sales folder. (NOT the Object ID).

        ghcrm/settings/content.ini (under the [CRMNodeSettings] section) - RootNode=[Root Node Goes Here]
        ghcrm/settings/ghcrm.ini (under the [CRMNodeSettings] section) - RootNode=[Root Node Goes Here]
                                                                         EmailTemplateContainerNode=[Root Node Goes Here]
                                                                         PutNewEntriesHereNode=[Root Node Goes Here]

# Didn't set up Sales group. Using administrator account.
9. Make sure the user group you intend to use has access to ezjscore::GHCRMFetch::getDataSet if you use the Sales group and not just the administrator account.

1. Create two workflows.
    -  Go to the Setup Tab in eZ Publish -> Workflows. (See send_email_workflow.jpg & send_email_multiplexer_workflow.jpg)
    *** Note: Workflows have to be exact for email to send. ***

    - Go to the Setup Tab in eZ Publish -> Triggers (workflows must be set up first)
    - Select Multiplexer from the dropdown. (content/publish/after)

/* Steps to send CRM Email */

2. You can either Save and Send Later (stores draft for later use), or Send Email Now.
